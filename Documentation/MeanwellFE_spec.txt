## **Programmable Power Supply Front-End Controller – Design Summary**

### **Overview**

This design implements a front-end user interface and control board for a **Meanwell programmable power supply**, managed via **CAN bus** using an **Arduino microcontroller**. The interface provides user control over voltage and current settings, displays real-time feedback, and communicates settings to the power supply over CAN.

### **1. Functional Description**

#### **Main Functions**:

* Allow users to set and buffer **voltage (V)** and **current (I)** values.
* Display real-time output values from the power supply.
* Enable or disable the output via a control button.
* Transmit buffered settings via CAN bus when prompted.

---

### **2. Major Components**

#### **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**

* **Arduino-compatible board** with:

  * Digital I/O lines for button and display interface
  * CAN bus support via a CAN transceiver module (e.g., MCP2515)

#### **Display**

* **Character LCD** with **parallel interface** (likely HD44780-compatible)

  * Controlled via 4-bit mode (RS, E, D4–D7)
  * Displays:

    * Voltage and current setpoints (`Vset`, `Iset`)
    * Buffered values (`Vbuf`, `Ibuf`)
    * Output readings (`Vout`, `Iout`)
    * Output state (`OP: 1` for ON)

#### **User Input Controls**

* **Two rocker switches**:

  * One for **voltage** adjustment (V+ / V−)
  * One for **current** adjustment (I+ / I−)
* **Two pushbuttons**:

  * `Set Buf`: Sends buffered values to the power supply
  * `OP On/Off`: Toggles power output state

#### **CAN Interface**

* Uses standard **CANH/CANL lines**
* Powered via onboard **+5V** supply
* Connected to Arduino via SPI-compatible CAN module

### **3. Power Supply**

* Board is powered via **+5V** input
* Onboard decoupling capacitors for voltage stability
* Supports powering external components including display and CAN transceiver

---

### **4. Connectors**

* **CAN Bus Output Connector**:

  * CANH, CANL
  * +5V and GND
* **Optional headers** for debug or expansion

---

### **5. Signal Flow Summary**

1. **User** adjusts V/I using rocker switches.
2. Adjustments update buffer values (`Vbuf`, `Ibuf`), displayed on screen.
3. **Set Buf** button transmits values to power supply via CAN.
4. **Output button** toggles output enable/disable.
5. Display updates all states and measurements dynamically.

### **6. Software Considerations**

* Arduino firmware handles:

  * Button debouncing and state management
  * LCD control using `LiquidCrystal` library
  * CAN bus communication using `MCP_CAN` library or equivalent
  * Control logic for buffering and output toggling

---

### **7. Physical Layout**

* **Compact PCB design** with:

  * Front-facing display
  * Top-mounted rocker and push buttons
  * Rear or side connectors for CAN and power
  * Through-hole and possibly SMD components for ease of assembly

---

### **Applications**

* Laboratory power supply control
* Remote-controlled power systems
* Embedded development requiring voltage/current staging
