⚠ Components Needing JLCPCB Part Numbers (11 types):
  - 164G_FC_BW-3LP LCD display (DS1) - May need to source separately
  - ESP32-DEVKITC-32E module (U2) - Module, may need extended parts
  - MCP2515-I/SO CAN controller (U1) - Check JLCPCB availability
  - ISO1050DUB CAN transceiver (U4) - Check JLCPCB availability
  - C143785 encoder (VR1, VR2) - PEC12R-4215F-N0024
  - Pin headers (JP2, JP3, JP4, U$2) - Through-hole, may be DNF
  - Switches (CHANGE, OUTPUT, SET_BUFFER, VIEW, I_DOWN, I_UP, V_DOWN, V_UP) - Through-hole, DNF
  - JP1 header - DNF

DNF (Do Not Fit) COMPONENTS:
-----------------------------
These components are marked as DNF and will be hand-soldered or sourced separately:
  - JP1 (1X02 header)
  - I_DOWN, I_UP, V_DOWN, V_UP (momentary switches)
  - All through-hole components

NOTES:
------
1. PCB Manufacturing:
   - Upload Meanwell_FE_v26_JLC_PCB.zip to JLCPCB
   - Board appears to be 2-layer based on file structure
   - Verify board dimensions and specifications during upload

2. Assembly Service:
   - Upload Meanwell_FE_v26_JLCBOM_2025-12-06.csv for BOM
   - Upload Meanwell_FE_v26_JLCPNP_2025-12-06.csv for PnP
   - Review component availability before ordering
   - Many components may need to be sourced as "Extended" parts or separately

3. Component Sourcing:
   - LCD display (164G_FC_BW-3LP) likely needs separate sourcing
   - ESP32 module may be available as extended part
   - Through-hole components (switches, headers) are DNF
   - Verify all IC part numbers match JLCPCB inventory

4. Quality Checks:
   - ✓ BOM component count matches PnP count (37 components)
   - ✓ All designators accounted for
   - ✓ Coordinates in millimeters
   - ✓ Top/bottom layers properly designated
   - ⚠ Some components need JLCPCB part number verification

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Review BOM file and add missing JLCPCB part numbers
2. Verify PnP coordinates look correct (compare with Gerber preview)
3. Check component availability on JLCPCB website
4. Update BOM with any part number corrections
5. Upload all files to JLCPCB
6. Review JLCPCB preview carefully before ordering
7. Consider ordering small prototype quantity first (5 boards)

PROCESSING NOTES:
-----------------
- Files processed using process_for_jlc.py script
- BOM parsed from Fusion Electronics export format
- PnP files combined from front and back layers
- Component matching uses preferred_jlcpcb_parts.txt library
- Format follows JLCPCB_Processing_Guide.md specifications
